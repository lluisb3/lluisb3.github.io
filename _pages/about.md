<p><div style='text-align: justify'>Hey there! I'm Lluis Borràs Ferrís, I am a biomedical engineer with a Master's degree in Computer Vision using DL/ML engineering. Whether it’s analyzing any kind of images from the medical domain to day by day images or developing solutions that enable machines to see and understand the world using AI, I’m always eager to take on new challenges and grow as a professional.</div></p>
<p><div style='text-align: justify'>Currently, I’m focused on leveraging the power of deep learning and AI to solve real-world problems. I’ve worked on projects to build a lung cancer classification systems using digital biopsies of the lung (Whole Slide Images), and 3D reconstruction of a scene recorded using a Virtual Reality Headset and applying AI to the scene to perform the 3D semantic instance segmentation of common objects present on it like a chair or a table. I’m always on the lookout for new challenges that push the boundaries of technology.</div></p>
<p><div style='text-align: justify'>This site is a glimpse into my work, showcasing some of my favorite projects. I’m passionate about staying on the cutting edge of technology, exploring new algorithms, and finding practical applications for the latest advancements in AI and computer vision.</div></p>
<p><div style='text-align: justify'>If you’re interested in collaborating on an exciting project or think I’d be a good fit for your team, feel free to reach out.</div></p>
