<div style='text-align: justify'>This paper presents a full automatic pipeline to classify lung cancer WSIs, considering four classes: Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer divided into LUng ADenocarcinoma (LUAD) and LUng Squamous cell Carcinoma (LUSC), and normal tissue. The pipeline includes a self-supervised algorithm for pre-training the model and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for WSI classification.</div>
